# the-notion

Random meme page idk, try it out:

https://josephharrisonlim.com/the-notion

Or customize it:

https://josephharrisonlim.com/the-notion?q=wednesday+my+dudes

> Warning: The images come from Bing lul

If you want to customize the text but not the image just add `s=1` to the query

https://josephharrisonlim.com/the-notion?q=wednesday+my+dudes&s=1

Or if you want to pick the image url, encode it such as `encodeURIComponent('https://your.image/of-a-frog.png')` and use the `i` query parameter:

https://josephharrisonlim.com/the-notion?q=wednesday+my+dudes&i=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F0a9hkw82lk621.jpg
